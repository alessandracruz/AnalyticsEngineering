      - name: room_type
        description: '[Entire home/apt|Private room|Shared room|Hotel]
        All homes are grouped into the following three room types:
        Entire place
        Private room
        Shared room
        Entire place
        Entire places are best if you''re seeking a home away from home. With an entire
        place, you''ll have the whole space to yourself. This usually includes a bedroom,
        a bathroom, a kitchen, and a separate, dedicated entrance. Hosts should note in
        the description if they''ll be on the property or not (ex: "Host occupies first
        floor of the home"), and provide further details on the listing.

        Private rooms
        Private rooms are great for when you prefer a little privacy, and still value
        a local connection. When you book a private room, you''ll have your own private
        room for sleeping and may share some spaces with others. You might need to walk
        through indoor spaces that another host or guest may occupy to get to your room.

        Shared rooms
        Shared rooms are for when you don''t mind sharing a space with others. When you
        book a shared room, you''ll be sleeping in a space that is shared with others
        and share the entire space with other people. Shared rooms are popular among flexible
        travelers looking for new friends and budget-friendly stays.'
